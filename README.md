# Godot Node Generator

A C# source generator for Godot 4.x that creates strongly-typed accessors for nodes in your scenes.

## Features

- Automatically generates type-safe properties for nodes in your Godot scenes
- Works with Godot 4.x C# projects
- No runtime cost - all happens at compile time
- Makes code more readable and maintainable
- Prevents errors from typos in node paths or wrong type casts

## Installation

1. Add this project to your solution or include the compiled DLL as a reference
2. Add the following to your .csproj file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="..\path\to\GodotNodeGenerator\GodotNodeGenerator.csproj"
                      OutputItemType="Analyzer"
                      ReferenceOutputAssembly="false" />
</ItemGroup>

<!-- Add your scene files as AdditionalFiles -->
<ItemGroup>
    <!-- Include all TSCN files in your project -->
    <AdditionalFiles Include="**\*.tscn" />
    
    <!-- Or you can specify specific scene files or directories -->
    <!-- <AdditionalFiles Include="scenes\**\*.tscn" /> -->
    <!-- <AdditionalFiles Include="res://scenes\Player.tscn" /> -->
</ItemGroup>
```

## Usage

1. Add your scene files as `AdditionalFiles` in your project file (.csproj)
2. Apply the `[NodeGenerator]` attribute to your Godot node classes
3. Specify the scene file path in the attribute constructor (or let it infer from class name)
4. Use the generated properties to access nodes

### Example

```csharp
using Godot;
using GodotNodeGenerator;

namespace MyGame
{
    [NodeGenerator("res://scenes/Player.tscn")]
    public partial class Player : CharacterBody2D
    {
        public override void _Ready()
        {
            // Instead of GetNode<Sprite2D>("Sprite")
            Sprite.Texture = ResourceLoader.Load<Texture2D>("res://assets/player.png");
            
            // Instead of GetNode<Camera2D>("Camera")
            Camera.Current = true;
            
            // Instead of GetNode<AnimationPlayer>("AnimationPlayer")
            AnimationPlayer.Play("idle");
        }
    }
}
```

Generated code will look like:

```csharp
// <auto-generated/>
using Godot;

namespace MyGame
{
    // Generated node accessors for Player
    public partial class Player
    {
        private Sprite2D? _Sprite;
        
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets the Sprite node (path: "Sprite")
        /// </summary>
        public Sprite2D Sprite => 
            _Sprite ??= GetNode<Sprite2D>("Sprite");

        private Camera2D? _Camera;
        
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets the Camera node (path: "Camera")
        /// </summary>
        public Camera2D Camera => 
            _Camera ??= GetNode<Camera2D>("Camera");

        private AnimationPlayer? _AnimationPlayer;
        
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets the AnimationPlayer node (path: "AnimationPlayer")
        /// </summary>
        public AnimationPlayer AnimationPlayer => 
            _AnimationPlayer ??= GetNode<AnimationPlayer>("AnimationPlayer");
    }
}
```

### Scene File Resolution

The generator looks for scene files that have been included as `AdditionalFiles` in your project. The `AdditionalFiles` mechanism is a standard Roslyn feature that allows source generators to access files without direct file I/O, which is important for incremental compilation and better IDE integration.

By default, it will look for a scene file with the same name as the class. 
For example, if your class is named `Player`, it will look for `Player.tscn` among your `AdditionalFiles`.

The source generator follows this process to find the scene file:
1. Try to find a file that exactly matches the path specified in the attribute
2. If not found, try to find a file with the same filename
3. If the path doesn't have a .tscn extension, try adding it
4. If still not found, use a dummy scene for testing purposes or report a diagnostic

You can override this by specifying the path in the attribute:

```csharp
[NodeGenerator("res://scenes/custom_player.tscn")]
public partial class Player : CharacterBody2D
{
}
```

## How It Works

The source generator:

1. Identifies classes with the `[NodeGenerator]` attribute
2. Parses the specified scene file to extract node information
3. Generates strongly-typed accessors for each node
4. Adds the generated code as a partial class

## Future Improvements

- Support for nested node paths (e.g. "UI/HealthBar")
- Support for binary (.scn) scene files
- Automatic detection of scene files in the project
- Enhanced error reporting and diagnostics

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite targeting various components:

- **SceneParserTests**: Tests the TSCN file parser with various scene structures
- **NodeGeneratorTests**: Tests the source generator's code generation capabilities
- **SourceGenerationHelperTests**: Tests the helper methods for code generation

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
dotnet test
```
